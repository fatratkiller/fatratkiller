# Welcome to @fatratkiller's Code Cosmos 🚀

Hello there! Welcome to my little space station in the vast universe of code. Here, you can get a quick scan of my coding journey and professional path:

## 🌐 My Coding Passion
- I have a profound curiosity and passion for **Full-Stack Development**, **Data Analysis**, and the **Web3 Open Source Community**.
- I'm keenly interested in the cutting-edge innovations in cryptography, and I'm quite sensitive to cryptocurrency price movements.
- My involvement has been deep with blockchain ecosystems like **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, **EOS**, **Cosmos**, and **Solana**, and I continue to develop on these public blockchains.
- Areas like **DeFi**, **NFTs**, and **SocialFi** are my favorites. Emerging asset classes always excite me.
- Check out my blog for some juicy insights into my explorations and thoughts.

## 🎓 Learning Journey
- Although I hold a Master's degree in IT, I consider myself an eternal novice developer, with my strengths lying in creative combinations rather than hardcore coding.
- Aware of my weaknesses, I'm always eager to learn new programming languages. So far, I've dabbled in **Python**, **R**, **Rust**, **Go**, and **Java**, and I'm currently getting my hands dirty with **Solidity** and other emerging blockchain languages.
- My repositories are filled with interesting little tools that you might find useful, so feel free to star them and dive into the world of Web3 with me.

## 💼 Professional Path
- My career began in China as an **intelligence analyst** and growth hacker for an investment fund, where I managed a community of over 300,000 investors.
- In 2021, I joined and co-founded **Bing Ventures**, serving as the **Research Lead** and **Investment Manager**. You're welcome to check out my public research papers and portfolio performance here.

## 🤝 Let's Connect
- Being an independent developer brings me immense joy as it allows the freedom to bring my ideas to life. However, I'm also open to **developer positions in Australia**.
- If you admire my skills and wish to connect, feel free to reach out. I'm open to discussing job opportunities, investing in Web3 projects, or anything intriguing in the tech world.
